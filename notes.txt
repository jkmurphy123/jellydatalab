Here are the basic steps to add a new dataset to the application:

1) Put the CSV into your data folder
2) Create a new import script for this dataset

Because the CSV has a header row, csv() will give you objects like:

{ 
  "EmployeeID": "123",
  "Department": "Engineering",
  "BaseSalary": "95000",
  "Bonus": "5000"
}


We take that entire object and store it in Record.data as JSON.

Your existing grid (DynamicDataGrid + DatasetGridPage) will automatically turn those keys into columns.


3) Run the import script

node scripts/import/import_salary_2024.cjs

4) View it in JellyDataLab

5) Customize

Tweak the impor script to map column names
Create a custom filter for the page 
Update slug page to point to new dataset
